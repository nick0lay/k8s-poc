# Cursor AI Rules for K8s POC Implementation

This directory contains AI rules for Cursor to assist you in implementing the K8s POC project. Each file contains guidelines for a specific technology stack or aspect of the project.

## How to Use These Rules

1. When working with Cursor AI, you can reference these rules based on the part of the project you're working on.
2. You can ask Cursor to "follow the guidelines in the cursor-rules directory" for specific assistance.
3. These rules should be considered as guidelines, not strict requirements. Adapt them as needed for your specific implementation.

## Available Rule Sets

- **typescript-fastify-rules.md**: Guidelines for TypeScript and Fastify application development
- **cdktf-infrastructure-rules.md**: Rules for infrastructure management with CDKTF
- **kubernetes-rules.md**: Best practices for Kubernetes resource definitions
- **docker-containerization-rules.md**: Guidelines for containerization and Docker
- **turborepo-monorepo-rules.md**: Rules for monorepo management with Turborepo
- **cicd-github-actions-rules.md**: Guidelines for CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Example Usage with Cursor

When working on a specific part of the project, you can guide Cursor with commands like:

- "Help me create a Fastify route following the typescript-fastify-rules.md guidelines"
- "Review this Kubernetes deployment manifest using the kubernetes-rules.md best practices"
- "Assist me with writing a CDKTF module for the VPC following cdktf-infrastructure-rules.md"

## Integration with Implementation Plan

These rules are designed to support the implementation plan outlined in the `plan.md` file. Reference both the plan and these rules when working on specific tasks to ensure consistent and high-quality implementation.
