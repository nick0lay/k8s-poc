# Cursor AI Rules for Kubernetes

## Resource Definition Best Practices
- Use YAML for all Kubernetes manifest files
- Implement proper resource requests and limits for all containers
- Set appropriate probes (readiness, liveness) for all deployments
- Use namespaces for resource organization
- Add appropriate labels and annotations to all resources

## Deployment Configuration
- Use Deployment resources for stateless applications
- Configure update strategies (RollingUpdate preferred)
- Set appropriate replica counts based on environment
- Implement pod disruption budgets for critical services
- Use pod anti-affinity rules for high-availability services

## Service Configuration
- Define appropriate service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Set correct target ports and selectors
- Configure session affinity if required
- Implement proper health check endpoints
- Add service annotations for cloud provider integration

## ConfigMap and Secret Management
- Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Implement Secrets for sensitive information
- Mount configuration as volumes or environment variables
- Use immutable ConfigMaps where possible
- Follow naming conventions for configuration resources

## Scaling and Resource Management
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) resources
- Configure appropriate CPU/memory thresholds for scaling
- Set proper min/max replica counts
- Use Vertical Pod Autoscaler where appropriate
- Implement custom metrics for scaling when necessary

## Networking and Ingress
- Configure Ingress resources with proper annotations
- Implement TLS for all public-facing services
- Set up proper backend service configurations
- Configure appropriate path rules and host-based routing
- Use network policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication

## Security Considerations
- Implement Pod Security Policies
- Configure ServiceAccounts with minimum permissions
- Use RBAC for access control
- Run containers as non-root users
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
